# EPA-Airly-Air-Quality-Data-Visualization-Bias-Corretion
Air-quality measuring that performs within 95% of the standard EPA federal monitors at 1/500th of the price. Pandas and SciKit-Learn were used to process preliminary data collected from our fleet of Airly® sensors. Incorporated Machine-Learning through SciKit’s linear regression toolkit to bias-correct the raw Airly® sensor data
and code creates easy-to-read graphics for the refined Airly® sensor readings using Python’s Matplotlib & Seaborn libraries.
