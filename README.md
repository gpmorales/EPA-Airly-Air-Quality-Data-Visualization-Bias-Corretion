# EPA-Airly-Air-Quality-Data-Visualization-Bias-Corretion
We designed air-quality measuring that performs within 95% of the standard EPA federal monitors at 1/500th of the price. Pandas and SciKit-Learn were used to process preliminary data collected from our fleet of Airly® sensors and data from the EPA federal monitors. Using linear regression and the EPA data as the variable for correction, this code produces coefficients for a bias correction model that is applied to the raw Airly readings and is then graphed + presented to our business partners.

Incorporates Machine-Learning through SciKit’s linear regression toolkit to bias-correct the raw Airly® sensor data and code creates easy-to-read graphics for the refined Airly® sensor readings using Python’s Matplotlib & Seaborn libraries. A dedicated excel/CSV file handler (SensorMerger.py) was used to concatenate several large excel sheets into singular data frames which contained all the desired data.
